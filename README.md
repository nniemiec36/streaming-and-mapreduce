# streaming-and-mapreduce
 Objectives:   To implement prototypical streaming algorithms. To think through implementation of a novel streaming algorithm under the constraints of limited memory. To implement parts of a map reduce system in order to become familiar with what it must do behind the scenes. To implement a map reduce version of a provided algorithm.
